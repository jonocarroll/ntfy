**ntfy** (pronounce: *notify*) is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. 
It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from 
any computer, entirely without signup, cost or setup. It's also [open source][ntfy_gh] if 
you want to run your own. Visit [ntfy.sh][ntfy] for more details.

{ntfy} is a lightweight R wrapper for this service. The magic sauce is just 
`POST` and `GET` calls equivalent to 

```
curl -d "Process Complete ðŸ˜€" ntfy.sh/yourSecretTopic 
```
  
but made to work nicely in an R workflow.

## Installation

You can install the released version of {ntfy} from CRAN

```r
install.packages("ntfy")
```

You can install the development version of {ntfy} from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jonocarroll/ntfy")
```

## Functionality

Follow the instructions at [ntfy.sh][ntfy] to install any of the 
mobile apps or use the web app. No sign-up or account is necessary.

Choose a topic (note: this isn't a password-protected service, so choose something 
obscure) and subscribe to it on your device.

Add the topic as an environment variable, e.g.

```r
usethis::edit_r_environ()

[...]

NTFY_TOPIC='yourSecretTopic'
#NTFY_SERVER='https://ntfy.sh'
```

The server will automatically be set to https://ntfy.sh unless you specify another.

This can be confirmed with 

```{r server}
ntfy_server()
```

With the package loaded, you can now send notifications which should appear on 
your device

```{r ntfy}
library(ntfy)
ntfy_send("test from R!")
```

This can be used in many ways. One would be to notify the completion of a process. 
The `ntfy_done()` function sends a notification with the (default) body

```
Process completed at <Sys.time()>
```

```{r done}
slow_process <- function(x) {
  Sys.sleep(8) # sleep for 8 seconds
  x
}

mtcars |> 
  head() |> 
  slow_process() |> 
  ntfy_done()
```

which results in a notification on subscribed devices

```
Process completed at 2023-07-04 17:00
```

When using the base R pipe `|>` the piped commands are composed together by the 
parser, so 

```
f() |> 
  g() |> 
    h()
```

becomes

```
h(g(f()))
```

We can use this fact to time the running of a process if the last function 
(above, `h()`) is `system.time()`. The `ntfy_done_with_timing()` function does exactly 
this

```{r done_with_timing}
mtcars |> 
  head() |> 
  slow_process() |> 
  ntfy_done_with_timing()
```

which sends the notification

```
Process completed in 8.003s
```

This service can also be used as a progress indicator via the 
[{progressr}][progressr] package - see 
`help("handler_ntfy", package = "progressr")` or 
https://progressr.futureverse.org/reference/handler_ntfy.html for more 
details.

If you're using a topic on a server that requires authentication, you can pass `auth = TRUE`, along with a username and password:

```r
ntfy_send(
  "test from R!", 
  auth = TRUE, 
  username = "example", 
  password = "super-secret-password"
)
```

Alternatively, you can set these as environment variables and they'll get used 
by `ntfy_send()` automatically:

```r
usethis::edit_r_environ()

[...]

NTFY_AUTH='TRUE'
NTFY_USERNAME='example'
NTFY_PASSWORD='super-secret-password'
```

```r
ntfy_send("test from R!")
```

The history of the notifications sent can be retrieved as well, with control 
over how far back to search (example output shown)

```{r history, eval = FALSE}
ntfy_history(since = "1h")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
structure(list(id = c("0oDpk4oisfNO", "4Fcy9kIL0m6Z", "AGXn4q0CirFT"
), time = c(1667988383L, 1667988413L, 1667990983L), event = c("message", 
"message", "message"), topic = c("yourSecretTopic", "yourSecretTopic", "yourSecretTopic"
), message = c("test from R!", "Process completed at 2022-11-09 17:31:03", "Process completed in 8.003s")),
row.names = c(NA, -3L
), class = "data.frame")
```


## API

The full ntfy.sh API should be supported, including sending a title and [tags](https://docs.ntfy.sh/publish/#tags-emojis)

![](man/figures/notification1.png){width=300}

![](man/figures/notification2.png){width=300}

## Images

Images can be sent within notifications by specifying as `image` either the 
filename or a `ggplot2` object (which will be saved to a temporary file)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, (aes(mpg, wt))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "ggplot images in {ntfy}")
ntfy_send("ggplot2 images in notifications!", 
          tags = c("tada", "chart"),
          image = p)
```

## Emoji

Supported tags (emoji) can be sent with the `tags` argument (one or more). These can be searched or shown with `show_emoji()` which will look for a given name in the compatible values, or search for it in the compatible metadata.

The compatible data is stored as `emoji` 

```{r}
data("emoji")
head(emoji)
```

with the tags stored as `tags` for easy auto-complete

```{r}
ntfy_send(message = "sending with tags!", 
          tags = c(tags$cat, tags$dog)
)
```

The compatible emoji can be shown with

```{r}
show_emoji("rofl")
```

If the name is not found in `aliases` (the compatible names) it will
be searched in `tags`

```{r}
show_emoji("lol")

show_emoji("pet")
```

You can force this behaviour with

```{r}
show_emoji("dog", search = TRUE)
```
