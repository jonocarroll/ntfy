**ntfy** (pronounce: *notify*) is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub
notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone
or desktop via scripts from any computer, entirely without signup, cost
or setup. It‚Äôs also [open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy)
if you want to run your own. Visit [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) for more
details.

{ntfy} is a lightweight R wrapper for this service. The magic sauce is
just `POST` and `GET` calls equivalent to

    curl -d "Process Complete üòÄ" ntfy.sh/yourSecretTopic 

but made to work nicely in an R workflow.

## Installation

You can install the released version of {ntfy} from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("ntfy")
```

You can install the development version of {ntfy} from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jonocarroll/ntfy")
```

## Functionality

Follow the instructions at [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) to install any of
the mobile apps or use the web app. No sign-up or account is necessary.

Choose a topic (note: this isn‚Äôt a password-protected service, so choose
something obscure) and subscribe to it on your device.

Add the topic as an environment variable, e.g.

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()

[...]

NTFY_TOPIC='yourSecretTopic'
#NTFY_SERVER='https://ntfy.sh'
```

The server will automatically be set to <https://ntfy.sh> unless you
specify another.

This can be confirmed with

``` r
ntfy_server()
#> [1] "https://ntfy.sh"
```

With the package loaded, you can now send notifications which should
appear on your device

``` r
library(ntfy)
ntfy_send("test from R!")
#> <httr2_response>
#> POST https://ntfy.sh/mytopic
#> Status: 200 OK
#> Content-Type: application/json
#> Body: In memory (135 bytes)
```

This can be used in many ways. One would be to notify the completion of
a process. The `ntfy_done()` function sends a notification with the
(default) body

    Process completed at <Sys.time()>

``` r
slow_process <- function(x) {
  Sys.sleep(8) # sleep for 8 seconds
  x
}

mtcars |> 
  head() |> 
  slow_process() |> 
  ntfy_done()
#>                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
#> Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
#> Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
#> Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
#> Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
#> Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
#> Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1
```

which results in a notification on subscribed devices

    Process completed at 2023-07-04 17:00

When using the base R pipe `|>` the piped commands are composed together
by the parser, so

    f() |> 
      g() |> 
        h()

becomes

    h(g(f()))

We can use this fact to time the running of a process if the last
function (above, `h()`) is `system.time()`. The
`ntfy_done_with_timing()` function does exactly this

``` r
mtcars |> 
  head() |> 
  slow_process() |> 
  ntfy_done_with_timing()
#>                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
#> Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
#> Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
#> Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
#> Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
#> Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
#> Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1
```

which sends the notification

    Process completed in 8.003s

This service can also be used as a progress indicator via the
[{progressr}](https://github.com/futureverse/progressr) package - see
`help("handler_ntfy", package = "progressr")` or
<https://progressr.futureverse.org/reference/handler_ntfy.html> for more
details.

If you‚Äôre using a topic on a server that requires authentication, you
can pass `auth = TRUE`, along with a username and password:

``` r
ntfy_send(
  "test from R!", 
  auth = TRUE, 
  username = "example", 
  password = "super-secret-password"
)
```

Alternatively, you can set these as environment variables and they‚Äôll
get used by `ntfy_send()` automatically:

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()

[...]

NTFY_AUTH='TRUE'
NTFY_USERNAME='example'
NTFY_PASSWORD='super-secret-password'
```

``` r
ntfy_send("test from R!")
```

The history of the notifications sent can be retrieved as well, with
control over how far back to search (example output shown)

``` r
ntfy_history(since = "1h")
```

    #>             id       time   event           topic
    #> 1 0oDpk4oisfNO 1667988383 message yourSecretTopic
    #> 2 4Fcy9kIL0m6Z 1667988413 message yourSecretTopic
    #> 3 AGXn4q0CirFT 1667990983 message yourSecretTopic
    #>                                    message
    #> 1                             test from R!
    #> 2 Process completed at 2022-11-09 17:31:03
    #> 3              Process completed in 8.003s

## API

The full ntfy.sh API should be supported, including sending a title and
[tags](https://docs.ntfy.sh/publish/#tags-emojis)

<img src="man/figures/notification1.png" width="300" />

<img src="man/figures/notification2.png" width="300" />

## Images

Images can be sent within notifications by specifying as `image` either
the filename or a `ggplot2` object (which will be saved to a temporary
file)

``` r
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, (aes(mpg, wt))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "ggplot images in {ntfy}")
ntfy_send("ggplot2 images in notifications!", 
          tags = c("tada", "chart"),
          image = p)
#> Saving 7 x 5 in image
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
#> <httr2_response>
#> 
#> POST https://ntfy.sh/mytopic
#> 
#> Status: 200 OK
#> 
#> Content-Type: application/json
#> 
#> Body: In memory (318 bytes)
```

## Emoji

Supported tags (emoji) can be sent with the `tags` argument (one or
more). These can be searched or shown with `show_emoji()` which will
look for a given name in the compatible values, or search for it in the
compatible metadata.

The compatible data is stored as `emoji`

``` r
data("emoji")
head(emoji)
#> # A tibble: 6 √ó 6
#>   emoji aliases         tags      category          description  unicode_version
#>   <chr> <chr>           <list>    <chr>             <chr>        <chr>          
#> 1 üëé    -1              <chr [2]> People & Body     thumbs down  6.0            
#> 2 üëç    +1              <chr [2]> People & Body     thumbs up    6.0            
#> 3 üíØ    100             <chr [2]> Smileys & Emotion hundred poi‚Ä¶ 6.0            
#> 4 üî¢    1234            <chr [1]> Symbols           input numbe‚Ä¶ 6.0            
#> 5 ü•á    1st_place_medal <chr [1]> Activities        1st place m‚Ä¶ 9.0            
#> 6 ü•à    2nd_place_medal <chr [1]> Activities        2nd place m‚Ä¶ 9.0
```

with the tags stored as `tags` for easy auto-complete

``` r
ntfy_send(message = "sending with tags!", 
          tags = c(tags$cat, tags$dog)
)
#> <httr2_response>
#> POST https://ntfy.sh/mytopic
#> Status: 200 OK
#> Content-Type: application/json
#> Body: In memory (162 bytes)
```

The compatible emoji can be shown with

``` r
show_emoji("rofl")
#> 
#>  ü§£ rofl 
#> 
```

If the name is not found in `aliases` (the compatible names) it will be
searched in `tags`

``` r
show_emoji("lol")
#> Unable to find that name directly.
#> Did you perhaps want...
#> 
#>  ü§£ rofl 
#> 

show_emoji("pet")
#> Unable to find that name directly.
#> Did you perhaps want...
#> 
#>  üê± cat 
#>  üê∂ dog 
#>  üêπ hamster 
#> 
```

You can force this behaviour with

``` r
show_emoji("dog", search = TRUE)
#> 
#>  üê∂ dog 
#> 
#> Did you perhaps want...
#> 
#>  üê© poodle 
#> 
```
