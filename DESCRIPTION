Description: The 'ntfy' (pronounce: notify) service is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub
    notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone or 
    desktop via scripts from any computer, entirely without signup, cost or 
    setup. It's also open source if you want to run your own.
